- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Suraj.
- ðŸ‘€ I have a special interest in modern web applications..

- ðŸŒ± I like to go hiking, content writing and itâ€™s been fun to use my experiences and skills in blog writing and making videos. I am open to feedback, learn new stuff and try it, and keeping myself busy.
-  I work well both independently and as part of a team. If you want to know more? I'd love to talk to you.
